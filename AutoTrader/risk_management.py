    Risk Managing Thread:

    Pre-Loop (run once):
      - Reads "risk_files/all_markets_isin.json", a JSON list of ISIN strings (e.g.,
        ["IRO9ZOBI4731", "IRO9ZOBI4732", ...]).
      - Groups these ISINs by their first 8 characters into master_groups.

    Main Loop (runs every second):
      1. Reinitialize master_records for every ISIN with default values:
             {"ISIN": isin, "BUY_VOLUME": 0, "SELL_VOLUME": 0, "AVERAGE_PRICE": 0, "DELTA": None}
      2. Retrieve portfolio data via api.portfo_analyse(). For each row whose ISIN is in master_records:
             - Update BUY_VOLUME, SELL_VOLUME, and AVERAGE_PRICE.
             - Read the corresponding "risk_files/<ISIN>_delta.json" file (which contains a number)
               to update DELTA.
      3. For each group (by ISIN prefix):
             - If any record in the group has DELTA == None, set the groupâ€™s averaged_delta to 0.
             - Otherwise, compute the weighted average delta as:

                   avg_delta = sum(delta * (|BUY_VOLUME| + |SELL_VOLUME|) * AVERAGE_PRICE) /
                               sum((|BUY_VOLUME| + |SELL_VOLUME|) * AVERAGE_PRICE)

               Then, if -config.risk_param <= avg_delta <= config.risk_param,
               set averaged_delta to 0 (neutral).
      4. For each master ISIN, update its "risk_files/<ISIN>_TRADE_DIRECTION.json" file with the computed averaged_delta.
      5. Wait 1 second and repeat until stop_event is set.
